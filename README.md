# Hospital-Records
The following is a project I submitted in school for final evaluation during my last year of highschool. The goal was to write a python code to do a couple of limited operation on an existing SQL database via python.
I decided to be a bit more ambitious and design a complete UI with the help of python that would simulate a "virtual" hospital including two updatable databases for patients and staff with varying access for different people - patients, staff members and the administrator who has full control.
One can add new records, change existing records, delete records, create a new database from the python interface without ever interacting with MySQL directly.
My reference material- the school textbook - contained only a limited information on mysql-connector and class in python, which is the main library used for python-MySQL interaction. Therefore, I was forced to stumble my way through OOPs tutorials and mysql-connector docs to complete the project.
I tried using tkinter to develop a UI for my program, however due to my limited exposure to designing at the time, the process was slow-going and I was forced to drop the idea as the deadline drew close and multiple bugs kept cropping up. I am hoping to revisit the project again once I am comfortably familiar to github.
I usually code offline, and have not worked on many group programming projects of significant size which would absolutely need git/github, therefore I am not comfortable with the platform. Going forward, I would like to code a UI with tkinter or some other language better suited for it and complete the starting project.
